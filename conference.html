<p>
Our conference this year is underscored by the fact that our current moment is a snapshot of a larger context. As Asian Americans, we are interested in connecting current events and social trends with past cultural and political movements and the legacy of Asians in America. With not only the pandemic, but police brutality, natural disasters, and revolutions occurring worldwide, we find ourselves looking for ways to make sense of ourselves and the world around us. While the past is the reason for our present, the future is dictated by our actions today, and as students and as citizens of the world, we want to move beyond passive understanding and have an active hand in shaping our future.

Alana J. Webster and Jacklyn Chung-Young are self-described “forward-thinking feminists” hailing from the sunny coasts of California. On their podcast Black and Yellow, they explore the complex experiences of being Black or Asian in modern-day America.  Each week, they bring in-depth research, personal experience, and most importantly, an intersectional lens to talk about issues relating to feminism, gender, race, and much more.  In this workshop, Alana and Jacklyn will discuss the importance of talking about these issues, their experiences on the podcast, and their advice on how to create space for these conversations in everyday life.

Community members and allies are invited to an hour long Asian Prisoner Support Committee political education workshop. In this workshop, you’ll learn about the impact of community organizing, accountability, community mobilied in the fight against Southeast Asian deportations, the Southeast Asian migration to school to prison to deportation pipeline, and the intergenerational trauma that stems from displacement rooted in colonization and US imperialism. Hear from impacted community members about their experience of migration, incarceration, redemption, and their continual fight to stop Southeast Asian communities who are now facing another form of displacement through the deportation machine.

What is cultural organizing? How can artists and cultural work contribute to community power and social change? We explore these questions and draw from our own experiences of working with various cultural collectives in New York City over the years, specifically with the Chinatown Art Brigade, The W.O.W.

        <p class="card-text">
		Since late 2020, we have seen the largest general strike in world history emerge from India. Working class communities have joined in solidarity, from trade unionists to students to farmers to stand up to agribusiness. But what exactly is behind this uprising? How do major agricultural corporations contribute to the exploitation of the everyday worker? And how has the pandemic brought movements forward for a more equitable world? Join this workshop to learn about the rich histories of the Farmers Protest and how it has made waves from Punjab to New York City.

Techno-Orientalism describes a phenomenon of imagining Asians as hyper-technological, and yet in need of Western saving.  David S. Roh will discuss the ways techno-orientalism has manifested in modern forms of media and speak on the implications of these stereotypes.

                  Specialized High School admissions has always been a controversial issue in the history of the New York City public school education. Most recently, proposed reform to the single-measure admissions process, the SHSAT, has bought up questions around equity, diversity, integration, and inclusiveness in the education system. For Asian Pacific Americans specifically, the Asian Model Minority Myth has made it challenging for us to take up space in education advocacy. How did we get here and where do we go?

                  Media-based organizing presents a way for communities of color to change the narrative on who creates solutions for our communities and allows us build our own visions of the future. Case studies highlight how we are now using media-based organizing to push back on white supremacist history and policy. 18MillionRising.org is a key resource on accessible ways to reclaim histories, strengthen organizing, and support rapid response interventions for Asian American student activists. Zines are one such way to get an immediate start with media-based organizing. Staff from 18MillionRising.org will discuss their successes and failures with utilizing media ecosystems, art and design, storytelling, and creative technologies to fuel community organizing, rapid response interventions, and political education. Attendees will participate in a group exercise and leave with a “mini zine” outlining strategies, takeaways, and additional learning resources.

But what does self-care look like for the average activist and community organizer? What does self care look like for you? Emotional labor is something we’re used to dealing with and it can become emotionally draining. How do we create safe spaces and communities of care where burnout isn’t the end result and instead we create communities of resilience? Come to this workshop to discuss and learn more!

During the time of COVID-19, many of us are in quarantine at home. For some, this may be a time for learning, self-care, and reflection. For others, this may be an anxiety-filled time as we embrace various forms of uncertainty. In this workshop, we will discuss what self-care may look like in quarantine, how to stay mentally well during this challenging time, and more. Video and microphone use are highly encouraged as we will utilize breakout rooms for small group discussions.                 </p>

The Asian American experience is shaped by societal messaging that we do not neatly belong anywhere at all. How can Asian Americans find grounding and navigate the road to finding support, especially mentorship, amidst a cultural landscape molded by the model minority myth - that we are doing just fine and don’t need any extra support? This workshop will provide a brave space for participants to reflect on how mentorship is essential and accessible for us all. Attendees will participate in a culturally-sensitive guided visualization on connecting with one’s Inner Mentor, a tool that can help you tap into your authentic inner wisdom and find belonging within yourself.            </p>

                  Indian Occupied Kashmir is the world’s most militarized zone. Since 2008, a generation of Kashmiri youth has protested against Indian rule, demanding azadi, or freedom. Nonetheless, despite a mass movement for self-determination, the international community has largely remained silent on Kashmir and India is able to leverage its soft power to silence Kashmiris. During this teach-in, the instructors will present a brief historical overview of the Kashmir issue, and discuss the contemporary context of state violence and repression and youth resistance.

Asian Fusion Dance is a club at NYU that promotes creativity and cultural expression by introducing individuals to the unique and diverse styles of Asian dance.

The performance contains two dance pieces performed by Cynthia Li, Shari Wang, and Grace Xu. The first dance is called 醉 (Zuì), which translates to "Drunk" and speaks of reminiscence and nostalgia for the beauty of days gone by. The second dance is a fusion of modern and Chinese classical dance, called 左手指月 (Zuǒshǒu zhǐ yuè), which translates to "Reaching Towards the Moon." The song is from a popular Chinese drama called "Ashes of Love," and expresses the feeling of loving someone even through the hardest times, in this life and the next.

                  Comics are a realm for storytelling, each panel a translation of emotion and experience. How can we work with this medium in a way that engages our identity and form connections? In this interactive workshop facilitated by Matt Huynh, we'll share technical skills and knowledge for telling stories visually, workshop stories we'd like to tell and characters we'd like to see, and talk about how we'd like to experience comics today — whether online, on our phones, or as printed artifacts. Come to explore these concepts and create our own comics in the process!

                  CUNY was a free university until the 1970s. Over the past few decades, CUNY has increasingly become a profit-making institution, prioritizing money over the needs of its students and faculty. The neoliberalization of our education is something that affects every aspect of our lives, but students and faculty are fighting back. Join us for a discussion with The Coalition of the Revitalization of Asian American Studies at Hunter (CRAASH), 7k or Strike, and student organizers who fought against Amazon HQ2. Learn about the incredible activism happening at CUNY and gain some organizing skills to bring back to your own campus!

                  This workshop will address the ways in which poetry can be a specific form of anti-colonial resistance and work to contour our own relationships to historical and current day imperialism. We will analyze two poetry texts, <em>Look</em> by Solmaz Sharif and <em>Seam</em> by Tarfiah Faizullah, and explore the parallels between their examinations of the War on Terror and the Bangladeshi Liberation War, respectively. This workshop seeks to highlight the ways that imperial violence directly and indirectly shapes our lives, and ultimately calls for the development of an anti-imperialist politics of poetry.

As Anakbayan New York is a comprehensive National Democratic mass organization that stands for the basic rights and welfare of Filipinos at in the Philippines and across the world, the workshop historicizes Filipino migration, explores the underpinning political and economic forces that shaped it, and how there came to be a diaspora of millions of Filipinos around the world.
