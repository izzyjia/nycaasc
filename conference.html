<p>
Our conference this year is underscored by the fact that our current moment is a snapshot of a larger context. As Asian Americans, we are interested in connecting current events and social trends with past cultural and political movements and the legacy of Asians in America. With not only the pandemic, but police brutality, natural disasters, and revolutions occurring worldwide, we find ourselves looking for ways to make sense of ourselves and the world around us. While the past is the reason for our present, the future is dictated by our actions today, and as students and as citizens of the world, we want to move beyond passive understanding and have an active hand in shaping our future.

This workshop looks at mapping the trajectory of harmful immigration policies in the US that began in xenophobic laws against Chinese workers and brings us to today's deportation of Southeast Asian communities by ICE. It will also explore how communities have organized against institutions like ICE that have risen across this historical arc. Together, we will be highlighting how raising our voices as powerful collectives has always been how we resist institutions that seek to erase us.        </p>

The goal of the workshop is to encourage and facilitate self expression through personal narrative in zine and booklet formats, specifically narratives centered around identity, racism, sexuality, and other experiences that Asian Americans face. We will first be analyzing visual narrative works in print that explore these issues and the many different storytelling tools that they use. We will also be looking at different zine/booklet formats to encourage creative styles that are informed by the stories themselves.The rest of the workshop will be devoted to creation, in which the students will spend time creating the concepts for their stories, writing, sketching, and drawing the final if time allows.        </p>

      <div class="card card-body text-dark">
        <p class="card-text">
From Japanese-internment camps to modern day panic-fueled hate crimes, we’ve seen how the the othering of AAPI communities leads to dangerous sociopolitical consequences. We've always needed strong AAPI leaders to speak out passionately during times of injustice and hate. In NYS, where Asian-Americans make up 10% of the population, we have less than 2% of the representation in our State government. This workshop will examine the role of Asian American legislators, government staffers, and political organizers in shaping AAPI representation and activism, and how youth organizing can change the world. What does it mean to be an Asian-American working in government and politics? How do we navigate the systems of power that have barred our community’s voices for so long? And how do we fight back and build movements that break barriers, redefine political power, and shape the future of activism and government?        </p>

          Young people of the digital age are exceedingly exposed to images, ideas, and individuals around the world but often report feeling a conflicting sense of disconnect. Our contemporary world offers so many glimpses and soundbites of issues around the world, but decision-paralysis seems to be just as crippling in the world of justice as it is on Tinder and Netflix.
What should I do? Where do I begin? What is my calling? These are questions this workshop will not necessarily answer but demystify. This workshop will introduce participants to the concept of “contextualized entry” developed specifically to help them begin mapping their participation in the “movement” may be.

          Beauty and success has often been defined through white supremacist terms, lands, and systems. This has made it disproportionately challenging or fully impossible for people of color to keep up under those constraints. Specifically among the Asian-American diaspora, the model minority myth moves us toward white-adjacency and away from progress. In this workshop, we will examine this type of oppression through a social-emotional lens. Attendees will be able to reflect on their own body image and the society that influences it.

                  Specialized High School admissions has always been a controversial issue in the history of the New York City public school education. Most recently, proposed reform to the single-measure admissions process, the SHSAT, has bought up questions around equity, diversity, integration, and inclusiveness in the education system. For Asian Pacific Americans specifically, the Asian Model Minority Myth has made it challenging for us to take up space in education advocacy. How did we get here and where do we go?

                  Media-based organizing presents a way for communities of color to change the narrative on who creates solutions for our communities and allows us build our own visions of the future. Case studies highlight how we are now using media-based organizing to push back on white supremacist history and policy. 18MillionRising.org is a key resource on accessible ways to reclaim histories, strengthen organizing, and support rapid response interventions for Asian American student activists. Zines are one such way to get an immediate start with media-based organizing. Staff from 18MillionRising.org will discuss their successes and failures with utilizing media ecosystems, art and design, storytelling, and creative technologies to fuel community organizing, rapid response interventions, and political education. Attendees will participate in a group exercise and leave with a “mini zine” outlining strategies, takeaways, and additional learning resources.

                  What is ‘self care’? This term is thrown around in many spaces - including activism-oriented spaces. But what does self-care look like for the average activist and community organizer? What does self care look like for you? Emotional labor is something we’re used to dealing with and it can become emotionally draining. How do we create safe spaces and communities of care where burnout isn’t the end result and instead we create communities of resilience? Come to this workshop to discuss and learn more!

          We hope to elicit deep conversations through an anonymous platform to discuss questions such as 1. What do you see are the gaps between our own perception of the status of Asian Americans versus the wider American public's perception? How should we bridge that gap and 2. What are some common harmful narratives that exists about how Asian Americans fit into the American socioeconomic landscape and what are some productive wayst to address them from both our end and the mainstream end?

For others, this may be an anxiety-filled time as we embrace various forms of uncertainty. In this workshop, we will discuss what self-care may look like in quarantine, how to stay mentally well during this challenging time, and more.

The Asian American experience is shaped by societal messaging that we do not neatly belong anywhere at all. How can Asian Americans find grounding and navigate the road to finding support, especially mentorship, amidst a cultural landscape molded by the model minority myth - that we are doing just fine and don’t need any extra support? This workshop will provide a brave space for participants to reflect on how mentorship is essential and accessible for us all. Attendees will participate in a culturally-sensitive guided visualization on connecting with one’s Inner Mentor, a tool that can help you tap into your authentic inner wisdom and find belonging within yourself.            </p>

                  Indian Occupied Kashmir is the world’s most militarized zone. Since 2008, a generation of Kashmiri youth has protested against Indian rule, demanding azadi, or freedom. Nonetheless, despite a mass movement for self-determination, the international community has largely remained silent on Kashmir and India is able to leverage its soft power to silence Kashmiris. During this teach-in, the instructors will present a brief historical overview of the Kashmir issue, and discuss the contemporary context of state violence and repression and youth resistance.

                  Comics are a realm for storytelling, each panel a translation of emotion and experience. How can we work with this medium in a way that engages our identity and form connections? In this interactive workshop facilitated by Matt Huynh, we'll share technical skills and knowledge for telling stories visually, workshop stories we'd like to tell and characters we'd like to see, and talk about how we'd like to experience comics today — whether online, on our phones, or as printed artifacts. Come to explore these concepts and create our own comics in the process!

                  CUNY was a free university until the 1970s. Over the past few decades, CUNY has increasingly become a profit-making institution, prioritizing money over the needs of its students and faculty. The neoliberalization of our education is something that affects every aspect of our lives, but students and faculty are fighting back. Join us for a discussion with The Coalition of the Revitalization of Asian American Studies at Hunter (CRAASH), 7k or Strike, and student organizers who fought against Amazon HQ2. Learn about the incredible activism happening at CUNY and gain some organizing skills to bring back to your own campus!

                  This workshop will address the ways in which poetry can be a specific form of anti-colonial resistance and work to contour our own relationships to historical and current day imperialism. We will analyze two poetry texts, <em>Look</em> by Solmaz Sharif and <em>Seam</em> by Tarfiah Faizullah, and explore the parallels between their examinations of the War on Terror and the Bangladeshi Liberation War, respectively. This workshop seeks to highlight the ways that imperial violence directly and indirectly shapes our lives, and ultimately calls for the development of an anti-imperialist politics of poetry.

                  "How did we get here?" Participants and facilitators use their own personal histories and narratives as Asian/Asian Americans to show the history of migration to the United States and other countries around the world. The workshop aims to educate youth on the root causes and problems of forced migration, putting focus on the experiences of the Filipino community while connecting it to global patterns of migration. As Anakbayan New York is a comprehensive National Democratic mass organization that stands for the basic rights and welfare of Filipinos at in the Philippines and across the world, the workshop historicizes Filipino migration, explores the underpinning political and economic forces that shaped it, and how there came to be a diaspora of millions of Filipinos around the world. Participants will learn about calls to action and how they can get involved.
